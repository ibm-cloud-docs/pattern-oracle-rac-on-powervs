# Observability Considerations
{: #Obsdrvability-considerations}

Typically, observability tools are integrated with a centralized Service Management Ticketing System to provide a single pane of glass for all operations activities.

When deploying Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) in a cloud environment, observability is crucial for ensuring high availability, performance, and efficient resource utilization. Observability in this context refers to the ability to monitor, analyze, and understand the behavior of the Oracle RAC system. Here are key considerations for observability of Oracle RAC in the cloud:

| **Architecture Decision**                 | **Requirements**                                                                                                                             | **Decision**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
