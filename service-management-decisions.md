# Architecture decisions for service management
{: #observability-decisions}

The following are architecture decisions for service management for the Oracle RAC on Power Virtual Server resiliency pattern.

Typically, observability tools are integrated with a centralized Service Management Ticketing System to provide a single pane of glass for all operations activities.

When you deploy Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) in a cloud environment, observability is crucial for ensuring high availability, performance, and efficient resource utilization. Observability in this context refers to the ability to monitor, analyze, and understand the behavior of the Oracle RAC system.
